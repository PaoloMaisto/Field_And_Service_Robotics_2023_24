This is the repository of the Field and Service Robotics 2023/2024 project.

The goal of the project is to control a car-like robot.
Where we want to get a smooth trajectory using Reed-Sheeps curves and then apply the 'Input-Output linearization' controller in order to follow that trajectory.

The 'software' folder contains the matlab and simulink files; the file 'Final_Project_FSR_report.pdf' is the latex report; the file 'FSR_PROJECT.pptx' is the presentation for the exam.
